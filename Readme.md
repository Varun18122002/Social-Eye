Cross-camera people detection and tracking plays a crucial role in enhancing surveillance
and security systems across various environments. The integration of this technology is essential for
several reasons. Firstly, it enables a seamless and comprehensive monitoring experience by allowing
the tracking of individuals as they move across different camera views. This capability ensures that
no blind spots exist in the surveillance network, providing a more robust and accurate overview of
activities. Additionally, cross-camera people detection and tracking enhance the efficiency of
security personnel, as they can quickly respond to incidents by seamlessly following individuals
through various camera feeds.

OBJECTIVE:
•
Establish a robust tracking mechanism that enables smooth transition and tracking of
individuals across different camera perspectives, maintaining accuracy and reliability.
•
Exploring the NVIDIA’s Deepstream and it’s model to detect and track the people and use
other algorithms to increase the recognition accuracy and collect embeddings.
•
Using the milvus tool for matching the data which is collected from the deepstream and
making insights out of it.
•Exploring other tools like kafka, apache spark.
•Evaluating the proposed model's performance against existing state-of-the-art methods.
•Develop a real-time visualization dashboard tool with Kibana to provide comprehensive
insights into the tracked individuals' movements and behaviours, facilitating efficient
monitoring and decision-making.
